# Remake-snake-ai-pytorch

You need to run the agent.py file for training
- file agent_QLN or agent_Double_DQN.py is an unlimited training file, you need to turn it off to get model.pth
- Use model.pth file and paste it into play.py or play_snakes.py

1. update_1
file play.py
 + Can change the color of the snake every time it eats a foot
 + foot can be changed to your liking if you want it to be fruit or something you assign a path to

2. update_2
file play_snakes.py
 + Snakes appear randomly
 + Score scale for each snake
 + Change foot to anything as long as you give it a path
 + When snakes touch each other, they will reset their score to 0 and play again from the beginning
File model_DQLN.py, agent_Double_DQN.py
 + Use a new, improved algorithm compared to update_1

BECAUSE THIS IS A REMAKE, YOU CAN SEE THE MAIN CODE HERE
